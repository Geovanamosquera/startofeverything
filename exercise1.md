#                   **AMAZON RIVER**

 The Amazon River is the largest river by volume of water in the world. It is by far the river with the highest water flow per flow, and it has the largest watershed in the world, covering more than 7 million square kilometers. *It is responsible for about one-fifth of the world's total river flow, with the water flowing through Amazonian rivers equals 20% of the Earth's liquid fresh water.*

* **Location**: It runs through the north of South America, the Amazon rainforest and flows into the Atlantic Ocean
* **River´s Path**: Its origin is in the source of the Apurimac River (high in the western part of the Andes mountain range),
in southern Peru, and flows into the Atlantic Ocean, in northern Brazil. Along its route, it receives, even in Peru,
the names of Carhuasanta, Lloqueta, Apurimac, Ene River, Tambo River, Ucayali and Amazonas. It enters the Brazilian 
territory with the name of Solimões River and finally, in Manaus, after the junction with the Negro River, as soon 
as its waters mix it receives the name of Amazonas and as such goes to its mouth in the Atlantic Ocean. Its mouth is
classified as mixed, as it has an estuary and a delta mouth. The Amazon River is the only one with a mixed mouth in the world.
